    * [Vector API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/469) - use CPU vector opertaions and accelerate primitive mathematical operations used for AI/machine learning (part of Panama)
* [Babylon](https://openjdk.org/projects/babylon/) - extend the reach of Java to foreign programming models such as GPUs
* [Valhalla](https://openjdk.org/projects/valhalla/) is augmenting the Java object model with value objects, combining the abstractions of object-oriented programming with the performance characteristics of simple primitives.

This is what we want, this is what is helpfull:

* Review and try things out. - What, lets' be specific about this and give examples
* Give us feedback, share your experience. Not 'why you do it this way' or 'what about my use case'
* Share our high level slides on social media and events
